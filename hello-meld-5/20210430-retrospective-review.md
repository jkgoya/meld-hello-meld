# hello-meld-5 retrospective

## Intro

The hello-meld-5 sample was created as a kind of (remote) "pair programming" exercise, as a way of passing on some technical knowledge about MELDand its supporting frameworks to a DH researcher.  It used as a starting point the [Music Scholars' Annotator](https://github.com/trompamusic/music-scholars-annotator), and embedded the logic into a "hello MELD" style ofg application.

The starting point was a copy of the `hello-meld-4` application, with `annotations`, `containers` and `graphics` directories copied from [Music Scholars' Annotator](https://github.com/trompamusic/music-scholars-annotator).  Changes were applied to `src/index.js` and files in the `public/` directory to correspond to the new application structure.

We then proceeded to add a new annotation type for a recording of the piece displayed, and changed defaults to use the "Hello MELD" sample piece.  Testing was performed against the [Inrupt community Solid server](http://inrupt.net/). Note that actual pods are allocated sub-domains of the server; e.g. [gklyne2021.inrupt.net](https://gklyne2021.inrupt.net/).

The steps we followed for adding a new annotation are outlined in [annotation-sample-link-to-recording.txt](./annotation-sample-link-to-recording.txt).
