## Steps to add new annotation:

1. [x] Add new annotation type to `annotationSubmitter.render`;  assign value string

2. [x] Add new annotation type in `annotationSubmitter.submitHandler`

3. [-] Add new annotation type logic to `addAnnotations` - add new render option for recording link annotation in `render` method.  NOT NEEDED: uses `this.props.annotationType !== "cueMedia"` branch of render logic, so nothing more to do here.

4. [x] Look at annotation rendering in `AnnotationItem` (invoked by `AnnotationList`)..

    - the motivation for recording annotations needed to be changed in `annotationSubmitter.submitHandler`, as used to select rendered format.

5. [x] In `selectableScoreApp.onReceiveAnnotationContainerContent` code to handle new motivation type.


NOTE: appears to be no selection type for whole piece (e.g. no fragment).

NOTE: duplicated logic between `onRefreshClick` and `onResponse` (refactor for DRY?).

NOTE: new annotation motivation (currently "recording") should be reviewed.

NOTE: there is still a problem that annotations are not saved in the specified container - they all end up in "public/".  LATER: see line 22 in `solidWrapper.js`.  FIXED: need to also set state value in `solidWrapper.js` - fairly obvious, but one I missed first time around.

NOTE: meld-cli-tool needs better handling/reporting of authentication failure.  It seems that access to the Solid directory fails unless there is an explicit ACL set of the new folder.

NOTE: in `annotationItem.js`, about line 600, code does crude attempt at URI resolution.  Better approach would be to use a URL handling library toi do the resolution properly.  @@@find URL resolution library in code - in rdflib?

NOTE: in `selectablScoreApp.js` it's not clear why the motivation switch logic is required - it appears to be setting class values on annotations.  E.g., why isn't this handled in `annotationItem.js`?
