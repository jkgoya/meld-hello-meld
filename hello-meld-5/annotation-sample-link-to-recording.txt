## Steps to add new annotation:

1. [x] Add new annotation type to `annotationSubmitter.render`;  assign value string

2. [x] Add new annotation type in `annotationSubmitter.submitHandler`

3. [-] Add new annotation type logic to `addAnnotations` - add new render option for recording link annotation in `render` method.  NOT NEEDED: uses `this.props.annotationType !== "cueMedia"` branch of render logic.

4. [.] Look at annotation rendering in `AnnotationItem` (invoked by `AnnotationList`)..

    - the motivation for recording annotations needed to be changed in `annotationSubmitter.submitHandler`, as used to select rendered format.

5. [ ] In `selectableScoreApp.onReceiveAnnotationContainerContent` code to handle new motivation type.


NOTE: appears to be no selection type for whole piece (e.g. no fragment).

NOTE: duplicated logic between `onRefreshClick` and `onResponse` (refactor for DRY?).

NOTE: new annotation motivation (currently "recording") should be reviewed.

NOTE: there is still a problem that annotations are not saved in the specified container - they all end up in "public/"
